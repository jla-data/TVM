\title{NPV â€“ Net Present Value}
\usage{
npv(
  interest,
  cashflows,
  dates,
  method = "compound",
  convention = "ACT/365",
  silent = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{interest}{Interest rate per annum. Either a scalar value, or vector.}

\item{cashflows}{Cash flows, as a vector.}

\item{dates}{Value dates for the cashflows vector.}

\item{method}{Compound or simple interest? Default is compound.}

\item{convention}{Interest rate convention; default is "ACT/365".}

\item{silent}{Should warning messages be suppressed? Default is no.}
}
\value{
Net present value of future cash flows
}
\description{
Discounted value of future cash flows; the date of the first cash flow is
considered as origin.
}
\details{
Supproted interest rate conventions are:
\describe{
  \item{ACT/365}{Computes actual difference in days, presumes there are 365 days in a year. Default.}
  \item{ACT/360}{Computes actual difference in days, presumes there are 360 days in a year.}
  \item{30/360}{Assumes that each month has 30 days and the total number of days in the year is 360.}
}
}
\examples{
one_thousand <- npv(
  interest = 10 / 100, # i.e. 10\% p.a.
  dates = as.Date(c("2019-01-01", "2020-01-01")), # i.e. one year
  cashflows = c(0, 1100)
)
