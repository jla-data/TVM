# TVM - Time Value of Money

Fifty shades of cash flow discounting.

Currently implemented functions (loosely inspired by MS Excel, but vectorized):

-   **dcf** – Day Count Fraction
-   **irr** – Internal Rate of Return
-   **npv** – Net Present Value
-   **pmt** – Annuity Payment
-   **ipmt** – interest part of an Annuity Paymnet
-   **ppmt** – principal part of an Annuity Payment

With hopefully more to come, but not very actively developed at present.

Implemented with minimal dependencies, mostly in base R.
